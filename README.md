# Python Algorithm Solutions â€“ University Practice
This repository contains my personal solutions to **algorithm problems** covered in university courses, written in **Python**. Each solution includes clean code and often brief comments or notes about the approach and time complexity.

# Key Highlights

- ðŸ“Œ All problems solved and tested on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com)
- ðŸ’» Written in clean, readable **Python 3**
- ðŸ“Š Includes basic time/space complexity notes
- ðŸŽ“ Focused on **algorithmic logic** only â€“ data structures are kept in a separate repository

## Topics Covered

- Sorting Algorithms (Merge, Quick, etc.)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear)
- Brute Force & Greedy Techniques
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Divide and Conquer
- Basic Dynamic Programming

Every solution in this repo has been:
- Submitted to Codeforces
- Passed all test cases
